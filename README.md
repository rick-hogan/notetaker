# notetaker
A note-taking RESTful Java application.

# Getting Started
1. Clone the current repository.

2. Unzip the downloaded zip file.

3. Open the terminal and cd to the newly unzipped folder.

4. Run the following. (Be sure you are in the notetaker-master folder) 
```
/.mvnw clean install
```
- This will generate a JAR file so that we can run the application.

7. We will now run our newly created jar file with the following command.
```
java -jar target/notetaker-0.1.jar
```

8. We can now use the api by going to http://localhost:8080/api/notes in your browser.
